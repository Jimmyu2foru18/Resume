                        My journey into coffee expertise began as a barista at Starbucks and evolved into a passion for understanding every aspect of coffee—from bean to cup. Through the Starbucks Coffee Academy and hands-on experience, I've developed comprehensive knowledge of coffee origins, processing methods, roasting techniques, and brewing principles.

                    <p>
                        As a certified Coffee Master, I've conducted numerous coffee tastings, educated customers and colleagues about coffee characteristics, and developed a refined palate for identifying flavor notes and quality markers in different coffee varieties.
